# Hellscape - Animated Preloader
Inspired by awwwards wining website [P10](https://p10.mubien.com), this project is a creative, multi-stage preloader animation for a webpage. Built using the GreenSock Animation Platform [GSAP](), it orchestrates a complex sequence of text transformations culminating in a split-screen effect that unveils the main content. Designed specifically for desktop environments, the animation delivers a visually engaging and memorable introduction.

> Note: This is a Desktop friendly animation and no support for mobile is implemented and will be included in later
